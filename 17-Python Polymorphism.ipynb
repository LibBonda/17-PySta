    "### 001 Polymorphism in Python \n",
    "- is a concept from object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated in a uniform manner. \n",
    "- It refers to the ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the object (or data type) it is operating on. \n",
    "- polymorphism allows the same operation or function to be used for different types of objects.\n",
    "- It makes it possible write more flexible and reusable code by allowing you to interact with objects based on their common interface rather than their specific type."

    "# Method Overriding (in Inheritance): \n",
    "-In a subclass, a method can have the same name as one in the parent class, but can provide a different implementation.\n",
    "- This is called method overriding which allows a child class to modify or extend the behavior of its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Duck Typing: \n",
    "- Python uses duck typing, which means that the type of an object is not explicitly checked at compile time.\n",
    "- Instead, the object's behavior is checked at runtime. \n",
    "- If an object has the necessary methods or attributes, it can be treated as if it were of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Binding: \n",
    "- The specific method that is called on an object is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type. \n",
    "- This is known as dynamic binding or late binding."
